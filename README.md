The following are what i have been able to do so far:
1. Using Auth0 to implement signup,login and logout Authentication
2. create the chat box, but show up after you have signup and login
3. All are on a single page
4. I have also host the app on Netlify for viewing and testing
5. Also include the link to codebase on my GitHub
6. framer-motion library is added to animate the login and logout component

Things left to do:
1. Enable anyone who sign-in to be able to communicate
2. Enable the mangodb database to store records of anyone who visit the site
